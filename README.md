To use this you must first install:
'keyboard' via 'pip install keyboard'
'playsound' via 'pip install playsound'
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This program will play a sound everytime you hit any key on your keyboard.
To set the sound simply put it as an mp3 file in the same folder as 'hitsounds.py'.
If you put multiple soundfiles in the folder it will randomly select one each hit, but it will never play the same sound twice in a row.
