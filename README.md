Keyboard Hit Sounds
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A python program that will play a sound everytime you hit any key on your keyboard.

HOWTO
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
First, install Python. Then install 'keyboard' via 'pip install keyboard' and 'playsound' via 'pip install playsound'.
Then double click 'hitsounds.py' and you can just leave it opened in the background.
To set the sound simply put an mp3 file in the same folder as 'hitsounds.py'.
If you put multiple soundfiles in the folder it will randomly select one each hit, but it will never play the same sound twice in a row.
